= Wishlist items / future wild plans =

* add a man page
* add tests
* seaparate "bsync_args" for local and remote execution
** e.g. "--blocksize" is allowed only for the local client
* synchronize all volumes of an LVM volume group
* use a template syntax for simplifiying repetitive source/target definitions
* apply lvresize for target LVM volumes
* visualize progress (requires status output from bdsync)
* mix command line arguments into the settings from the config file
** maybe "cliapp" would help here?
* store patches remotely instead of applying them (for incremental backups)
* add "verify" operation
* research if LVM offers a change journal for quicker synchronization
